### Guest Speaker

Eric Scrivner, Coinbase engineer, will be talking about forks, what they are, how exchanges can protect against them, and how to protect against their negative outcomes.

Eric was tasked with implementing replay protection for BCH/BSV/S2x and so has a wealth of experience.

He'll also touch on why Bitcoin is so averse to hardforks.

### Socratic Seminar

We are excited to introduce our very first Socratic Seminar!

Inspired by Bitdevs NY, this is an event for those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. The Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information sharing, and lively discussion.

Discussion topics from a variety of sources are collated by meetup members in the weeks preceding the events. We investigate pull requests in the Bitcoin Core, lnd, and other relevant repositories; we study network statistics, research papers, technical blog posts and other interesting content. To complete the meeting, members present open source projects, companies, research and other relevant materials. A feedback and Q&A section follow.

Please contact the organizers if you'd like to present at the Socratic event or have a recommended topic for discussion: ecurrencyhodler at gmail.

A post will be made the day of the event which outlines discussion topics. Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event is NEVER recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.
